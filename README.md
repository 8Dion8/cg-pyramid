# cg-pyramid
A generator of a language pyramid for a specific question.

IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE:

Create a pull request to data.json with added languages. Each language should have a name, Primary color that will be used for the background and secondary color for the text. The name should be the same as you would indicate it in a PPCG post, so, for example, not just `C++`, but `C++ (gcc)`. This applies to different language versions, such as `Python 3` and `Python 2`. Colors should be in Hex RGB form with a prepended `#` symbol. If you want to correct already existing language data than it is prefferable to provide a link to where you found the corrected data. For further examples see the existing document. Fonts are optional - if you do not wish to specify a font, than please leave a blank string instead of the font.
